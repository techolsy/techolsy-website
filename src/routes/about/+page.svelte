  <p class="{ pTags }">
    <i>Hej!</i> I’m a Swedish systems engineer with a passion for problem solving, efficiency, 
    and all things tech. By day, I design and optimize systems that keep businesses running smoothly. 
    Whether it's software architecture, automation, or troubleshooting complex issues, 
    I thrive on finding innovative solutions to technical challenges.
  </p>
  <p class="{ pTags }">
    But when the workday ends, you'll often find me immersed in music. 
    Whether I'm playing the guitar, experimenting with new melodies, 
    or simply unwinding with my favorite tracks, music is my creative escape. 
    It balances the structure of engineering with the freedom of expression, giving me the best of both worlds.
  </p>
  <p class="{ pTags }">
    Outside of tech and music, I enjoy exploring new ideas, collaborating with like-minded people, 
    and continuously learning because there’s always something new to discover.
